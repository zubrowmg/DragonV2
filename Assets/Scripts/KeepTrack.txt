MAY CAUSE FUTURE ERRORS:
1. The InnerCorner prefab's 2d colliders don't quite match the HorizontalWall and VerticalWall 2d colliders when generated.
2. Progression script createStartingZonePathing has small subarea right now, so I can't put down error messages for when too many "small" subareas are detected
